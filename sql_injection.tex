\chapter{MYSQL Injection}

\section{Observation}

We discovered that the request \textit{host-ip/sc-course/views/transactions/tan\_entry.php?transaction\_id=x} is vulnerable to MYSQL Injections.
The attacker has to be logged in as user in order to create a new transaction . After inserting an account number and an amount for the new transaction the above-named request is sent. The user now would have to insert the TAN. At this point the parameter "transaction\_id can be used for all kind mysql  injections.


Likelihood: high\newline

Impact:      	high\newline

Risk: high \newline

\section{Discovery}
This vulnerability was discovered by the tool sqlmap. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{sqlmap -u "host-ip/sc-course/views/transactions/tan\_entry.php?transaction\_id=x"}
\end{enumerate}



\section{Likelihood}
Assuming that the attacker has basic knowledge about MySql-Injection and knows how to use sqlmap, it's very likely that this vulnerability will be exploited.


\section{Implication}
The vulnerability in combination with sqlmap leads to full compromise of all data, stored in the database. The attacker can hijack information about the names of databases, tables, columns of tables and can even dump whole tables.  In our special case, it was even possible to get the users' passwords in plaintext, because they weren't hashed.
You can also get the name and the password of the root user of the database. This was benifited by a weak password, whereby the plain password could be recovered from the received hash within seconds. This results in full write access to the database for the attacker.


\section{Recommendations}
It's highly recommended, that all inputs for SQL queries are sanitized by escaping the ' character.
Another option is to create query objects via msqli instead of using simple query strings.
This objects will automatically sanitized all inputs. For more information, please go to \url{https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL\_Injection}
